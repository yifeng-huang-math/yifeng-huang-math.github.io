                <summary>Affine stacks</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>In this talk, I will discuss Toen's theory of affine stacks and their relation to unipotent group schemes. I will also briefly talk about how this is applied in studying certain unipotent homotopy group schemes associated with algebraic varieties studied in joint work with Emanuel Reinecke. </p>

                <summary>Counting curves in determinantal varieties and a connection to quiver mutations</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Suppose X is a smooth projective variety, E and F are vector bundles on X, and M: E —> F is a map of vector bundles.  More concretely, M defines a family of matrices {M_x}, parametrized by the points x of the variety X.  For a positive integer k, we can define the kth determinantal variety of M to be the locus of points x in X for which the linear map M_x has rank at most k.  Such varieties give some of the simplest examples of subvarieties of X which are not complete intersections.  

                Determinantal varieties are almost always singular, however there are two natural desingularizations, called the PAX and PAXY models, defined using basic concepts from linear algebra.  It is natural to ask what the relationship is between these two resolutions: How do their cohomology rings compare?  their derived categories?  etc… 
                
                In this talk I will describe a beautiful correspondence, conjectured by physicists, between the number of curves in each of the two resolutions.  I will give a sketch of the proof and connect this correspondence to mutations of quiver varieties.  This is based on joint work with Nathan Priddis and Yaoxiong Wen.</p>

                <summary>An introduction to the gauged linear sigma model</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>A Landau—Ginzburg model (Y, w) consists of a smooth complex variety Y together with a function w: Y—> <b>C</b>. Curve counting invariants have recently been defined for a large class Landau—Ginzburg models. The theory goes by the name of the gauged linear sigma model, and generalizes, among other things, the Gromov—Witten theory of hypersurfaces. In this talk I will give a gentle introduction to the theory, focusing on examples.</p>

                <summary>Tate traces and classification of Chow motives</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>This talk is based on a joint work with Charles De Clercq. The main result is a classification theorem for some Chow motives with finite coefficients, which applies, notably, to motives of projective homogeneous varieties under some semi-simple algebraic groups. The result uses a new invariant, the Tate trace of a motive, defined as a pure Tate summand of maximal rank. If time permits, the notion of critical variety will be presented, as an application of our result.</p>
