                <summary>Real forms of almost homogeneous SL2-threefolds</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Given a complex algebraic variety X, a classical problem in algebraic geometry is to determine the real forms of X, where a real form is an algebraic variety Y which becomes isomorphic to X over the complex numbers. We are interested in a variant of this problem, in the case where X is a G-variety, i.e., an algebraic variety equipped with the action of a complex algebraic group G, and Y is an F-variety defined over the real numbers, for some real algebraic group F. Here we require that over the complex numbers, the algebraic groups F and G should become isomorphic, and X and Y should become G-equivariantly isomorphic.

                After defining these notions and illustrating them with examples, I will consider the special case where G = SL2 and X is an almost homogeneous SL2-threefold. This means that X contains an open dense SL2-orbit. These threefolds are well known in algebraic geometry; for example, they come up in the classification of Fano varieties and in the study of algebraic subgroups of the Cremona group. I will explain how we can classify their equivariant real forms. I will also  discuss the connection between equivariant and non-equivariant real forms ("non-equivariant" means that we disregard the SL2-action).</p>
