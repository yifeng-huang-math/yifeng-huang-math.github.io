                <summary>Matrix points on varieties and punctual Hilbert (and Quot) schemes</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Moduli spaces often have interesting enumerative properties. The goal of this talk is to introduce some enumerative results on solutions of matrix equations and zero-dimensional sheaves over singular curves. To motivate them, I first discuss several moduli spaces in general, which I put onto the "unframed" side and the "framed" side. The unframed side includes the commuting variety AB=BA of n x n matrices, the variety of commuting matrices satisfying polynomial equations (the titular "matrix points on varieties"), and the moduli stack of zero-dimensional coherent sheaves on a variety. The framed side includes the Hilbert scheme of points on a variety, or more generally, the Quot scheme of zero-dimensional quotients of a vector bundle on a variety. The enumerative properties to be considered are point counts over finite fields, the Euler characteristics of complex varieties, and the motive in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. I will explain some general connections within and between the two sides, and known results for smooth curves and smooth surfaces. Finally, I will discuss recent results on singular curves. This talk is based on arxiv: 2110.15566 and ongoing joint work with Ruofan Jiang. </p>

                <summary>A discretization of a derived moduli space arising from gauge theory</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>One could say that an ulterior motive for this talk is to understand, through an example, how to construct derived moduli spaces out of L-infinity algebras (which are homotopical generalizations of Lie algebras). L-infinity algebras produce derived moduli spaces or stacks, and we will see how one can change (up to homotopy) the underlying L-infinity algebra and compare their corresponding derived spaces/stacks. In this talk, we will use a discretization of matrix valued differential forms to produce an ind-finite (i.e., inductive limit of finite dimensional pieces) model of a derived moduli space whose classical locus is the moduli space of complex vector bundles with flat connections on a (closed, oriented) topological 3-manifold M with a triangulation K_M.</p>

                <p>It is known that a natural derived enhancement of the moduli space of flat bundles of a closed, oriented 3-manifold should carry a -1 shifted symplectic structure. We will see how such a -1 shifted symplectic structure can be constructed on our ind-finite model out of L-infinity data. In fact, this -1 shifted symplectic structure can be generated out of the Chern&ndash;Simons action functional and some homotopy data associated with it. One can think of this lift of the -1 shifted symplectic structure as an example of -1 shifted prequantization. The existence of this associated data implies that a certain homotopy version of the Chern&ndash;Simons functional induces a d-critical structure on the classical moduli space of vector bundles with flat connection on M.</p>
                    
                <p>This talk is based on ongoing joint work with Kai Behrend.</p>

                <summary>Classifying involutions of Azumaya algebras on schemes</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>An involution on a ring A is a self-map of order 2 that is additive and reverses the order of multiplication. I will motivate the work by explaining the classification of involutions of central simple algebras over fields. In this context, the involution acts either trivially or as a Galois action on the centre.
                </p>

                <p>I will explain what an Azumaya algebra A on a scheme X is, where the action on X can be considerbly more complicated, and give a definition of "involution" that fits this context. I will then give a classification of involutions into types, based on the local classification of the involution at the fixed points of the action of the involution on X. I will then present work in progress dedicated to determining which types actually arise. If time permits, I will make some remarks about extending the definition of "Brauer group" to this setting. The entire talk is based on joint work with Uriya First.</p>
