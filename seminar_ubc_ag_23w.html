                <summary>Matrix points on varieties and punctual Hilbert (and Quot) schemes</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Moduli spaces often have interesting enumerative properties. The goal of this talk is to introduce some enumerative results on solutions of matrix equations and zero-dimensional sheaves over singular curves. To motivate them, I first discuss several moduli spaces in general, which I put onto the "unframed" side and the "framed" side. The unframed side includes the commuting variety AB=BA of n x n matrices, the variety of commuting matrices satisfying polynomial equations (the titular "matrix points on varieties"), and the moduli stack of zero-dimensional coherent sheaves on a variety. The framed side includes the Hilbert scheme of points on a variety, or more generally, the Quot scheme of zero-dimensional quotients of a vector bundle on a variety. The enumerative properties to be considered are point counts over finite fields, the Euler characteristics of complex varieties, and the motive in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. I will explain some general connections within and between the two sides, and known results for smooth curves and smooth surfaces. Finally, I will discuss recent results on singular curves. This talk is based on arxiv: 2110.15566 and ongoing joint work with Ruofan Jiang. </p>

                <summary>A discretization of a derived moduli space arising from gauge theory</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>One could say that an ulterior motive for this talk is to understand, through an example, how to construct derived moduli spaces out of L-infinity algebras (which are homotopical generalizations of Lie algebras). L-infinity algebras produce derived moduli spaces or stacks, and we will see how one can change (up to homotopy) the underlying L-infinity algebra and compare their corresponding derived spaces/stacks. In this talk, we will use a discretization of matrix valued differential forms to produce an ind-finite (i.e., inductive limit of finite dimensional pieces) model of a derived moduli space whose classical locus is the moduli space of complex vector bundles with flat connections on a (closed, oriented) topological 3-manifold M with a triangulation K_M.</p>

                <p>It is known that a natural derived enhancement of the moduli space of flat bundles of a closed, oriented 3-manifold should carry a -1 shifted symplectic structure. We will see how such a -1 shifted symplectic structure can be constructed on our ind-finite model out of L-infinity data. In fact, this -1 shifted symplectic structure can be generated out of the Chern&ndash;Simons action functional and some homotopy data associated with it. One can think of this lift of the -1 shifted symplectic structure as an example of -1 shifted prequantization. The existence of this associated data implies that a certain homotopy version of the Chern&ndash;Simons functional induces a d-critical structure on the classical moduli space of vector bundles with flat connection on M.</p>
                    
                <p>This talk is based on ongoing joint work with Kai Behrend.</p>

                <summary>Classifying involutions of Azumaya algebras on schemes</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>An involution on a ring A is a self-map of order 2 that is additive and reverses the order of multiplication. I will motivate the work by explaining the classification of involutions of central simple algebras over fields. In this context, the involution acts either trivially or as a Galois action on the centre.
                </p>

                <p>I will explain what an Azumaya algebra A on a scheme X is, where the action on X can be considerbly more complicated, and give a definition of "involution" that fits this context. I will then give a classification of involutions into types, based on the local classification of the involution at the fixed points of the action of the involution on X. I will then present work in progress dedicated to determining which types actually arise. If time permits, I will make some remarks about extending the definition of "Brauer group" to this setting. The entire talk is based on joint work with Uriya First.</p>

                <summary>On the anisotropy theorem of Papadakis and Petrotou</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Papadakis and Petrotou showed that the anisotropy of a quadratic form implies the Hard Lefschetz theorem for simplicial homology spheres in characteristic 2. These spheres are a special case of the broader family of pseudo-manifolds. In this talk, I will explain how we define a mixed volume on pseudo-manifolds using an integration map, which is linear over a connected sum decomposition. Using this decomposition, we explicitly describe the quadratic form and prove an additional combinatorial conjecture of Papadakis and Petrotou, which turns out to imply all characteristic 2 anisotropy results for pseudo-manifolds and spheres. This is joint work with Kalle Karu.

                <summary>Fano schemes of singular symmetric matrices</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>Fano schemes are moduli spaces that parameterize linear spaces contained in an embedded projective variety. In this talk, I investigate the Fano schemes parameterizing linear subspaces of symmetric matrices whose elements are all singular. I discuss their irreducibility and smoothness and characterize when they are connected. As an application, I outline how to use the geometry of these schemes to give alternative proofs for several results on subspaces of singular symmetric matrices.</p>

                <summary>Log canonical threshold for the Weyl discriminant</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b> The Weyl discriminant is a polynomial function on a Lie algebra (which generalizes the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix), which arises in many questions in                    representation theory. We compute the log canonical threshold of this polynomial, and from it, make a more precise qualitative statement about local integrability of Fourier transforms of orbital integrals that appear in Harish-Chandra's work and are ubiquitous in harmonic analysis on reductive p-adic groups. This is joint work in progress with Itay Glazer and Yotam Hendel.</p>

                <summary>Automorphic functions for curves over local non-archimedean fields.</summary>
                <p><b>Abstract. </b>This is a joint work with Alexander Braverman and David Kazhdan.
                The goal is to understand Hecke operators on the Schwartz space of half-densities over
                the stack of G-bundles on a curve over a local non-archimedean field. Assuming that the curve
                has good reduction, we reduce the problem to studying functions on G-bundles over the
                reductions of the curve modulo powers of the maximal ideal. We introduce an analogue of
                the subspace of cuspidal functions and study it using tools from representation theory.
                It contains the usual space of cuspidal functions for the reduction of the curve over the finite field.
                We identify some subspaces of cuspidal functions, which show up modulo the square of the maximal ideal, 
                with functions on certain Hitchin fibers.</p>
